    <h2 class="text-orange">Background</h2>
    <p>The Youth Observatory (aka Youth SIG) was an idea borned in the context of the Youth@IGF 2015, a program led by Internet Society and CGI.br initiative that tried to increase the participation of youth in the areas of discussion of Internet governance in Latin America and the Caribbean and was attended by 120 young people from the region.</p>
    <p>There is no formal date of launch because the idea of making the Youth Observatory was evolved during the program, but at the end of September 2015 we had already decided the name of the organization and its main objectives. At this stage the first major collaborative project was the writing and publication of the "Youth Declaration", a document written in Spanish, Portuguese and English that expressed our concerns and wishes about the participation of youth in the areas of discussion of Internet governance. Copies of this document were delivered to different personalities. </p>
    <p>The first physical meeting of the Youth Observatory members was held in Joao Pessoa (Brazil), during the X Internet Governance Forum, where they were finalized objectives, certain responsibilities were established and communication channels were set up to undertake to formalize the organization. </p>
    <p>This process ended in February 2016 when we received the approval of ISOC and we were recognized with the status of "Special Interest Group" (SIG), which means that since that moment we have all the rights enjoyed by chapters local ISOC, including which it is funding, advice and logistical support to achieve our goals, as well as been supported by an organization with global reach.</p>
    <p>Currently, the Youth SIG has more than 80 young people from different countries with membership and very active in the various working groups. The organization has a solid structure and rules and regulations that enable its continued growth.</p>
